Kalman Filtering
  model in a probabilistic manner a dynamic world. 

Robot Mapping
  using probabilistic techniques to map out the surrounding environment around the robot.

Robot localization using particle filters.
  incorporate different aspects of sensor information to keep track of the robot's pose over time.
