Density and Distribution Functions


  Experiment
  sample space: set of all possible outcomes of experiment
  elementary event: single outcome of the set


Probability Measure
Sigma Algebra: deal wtih countably infinite or uncountable space

Basic Consequences

Independence: Given a probability space, two events A and B are independent if and only if:
Conditional Probability
  (two coin flips) what is the probability that both are head, given at least one is head?


Bayes Rule
  posterior
  likelihood
  prior
  evidence


Random Variables

Density/Distribution Functions


1D Gaussian Distribution
Multivariate Gaussians
  Mean Covariance Properties of these distributions
Gaussian Mixture Models

The two parameters (mean and variance) are easy to compute and interpret



Central Limit Theorem:
Expectation of the mean of any random variables converges to Gaussian
